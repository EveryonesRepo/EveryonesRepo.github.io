        <p>This is a list of libraries that were loaded into the process that crashed.</p>
        <p>On jailbroken devices, these libraries will most likely be tweaks, though they could be libraries that are <em>used</em> by tweaks or by the (crashed) program itself.</p>
        <p>It is possible that one or more of these libraries were partly or completely responsible for the crash. However, CrashReporter's suspect-detection routine did not find any such evidence.</p>
        <p>This list only includes libraries that were installed with the "dpkg" program (e.g. via Cydia). Libraries (and frameworks) included in iOS and libraries installed in any other way are not listed here (though these libraries <em>can</em> be found in the crash log itself).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, trusted libraries, specifically the libraries that make up Substrate, are also not listed.</p>

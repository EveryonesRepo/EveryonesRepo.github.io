        <p>Apps are the most common type of program on iOS, and the type that users are most familiar with.</p>
        <p>Most apps have an icon on the home screen, and display a full-screen window when launched.</p>
        <p>iOS includes several built-in apps, such as Notes, Phone, and Weather. The home screen, called SpringBoard, is also an app (albeit a very special one).</p>
        <p>Everything that can be installed via the App Store is an app. Apps can also be installed via Cydia, though most of the packages available via Cydia are not apps.</p>

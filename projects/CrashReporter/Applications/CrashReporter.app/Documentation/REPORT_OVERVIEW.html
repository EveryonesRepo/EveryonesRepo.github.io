        <h1>What is a Crash?</h1>
        <p>A crash is when a program ends unexpectedly.</p>
        <h1>What Causes a Crash?</h1>
        <p>A crash can occur for any number of reasons, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An issue (a bug) in the program itself.</li>
            <li>An issue in a library that the program depends upon.</li>
            <li>An issue in the operating system (iOS).</li>
            <li>An issue in a tweak (a type of library) loaded into the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reasons that a tweak might cause a crash include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An incompatibility with the installed version of iOS.</li>
            <li>An incompatibility with the version of the program that the tweak is being loaded into.</li>
            <li>An incompatibility with another tweak that is being loaded into the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to Resolve</h1>
        <p>Whether or not CrashReporter was able to determine any suspects, there are steps that should be taken before contacting a program or library's author.</p>
        <p>First, it is important to determine exactly when a crash occurs. If the author is unable to replicate the crash, it may not be possible for him or her to provide a solution.</p>
        <p>Second, if the crash occurs often and/or is easily repeatable, causes for the crash can be narrowed down by temporarily uninstalling any tweaks that may have been responsible and testing to see if the crash still occurs. Start with the main suspect, if any was found; uninstall the library, <em>reboot</em> the device, and test to see if the crash still occurs. Once the crashing stops, reinstall all but the last uninstalled tweak, reboot once more, and confirm that the crashing does not return. The last uninstalled library can then be assumed to be the most likely cause, or at least the trigger, for the crash.</p>
        <p>If the crash still occurs even when all tweaks have been uninstalled, then the crash is most likely due to an issue in the program itself.</p>
        <h1>Contacting the Author</h1>
        <p>To contact the author of the program that crashed or of any of the listed libraries, tap on the desired item and choose "Contact author".</p>
        <p>A contact form will be displayed with the crash log, syslog, and other information attached. A space is provided for entering information about the crash; this is where information regarding when the crash occurs and how to replicate it should be listed. Remember, the more information provided, the more likely the author will be able to help.</p>
        <p>When finished filling out the form, an email will be generated. Please <em>do not</em> remove any of the information included in the email. Some authors may not respond if any of this information is missing.</p>
        <h1>A Note on Piracy</h1>
        <p>Please think twice before contacting an author if the installed program or library is pirated.</p>
        <p>Users of pirated software may experience issues that would not occur with non-pirated versions. This may be intentional - the author may have included anti-piracy measures in the software. It may also be due to a conflict with another tweak; pirated packages break dpkg's conflict-detection.</p>

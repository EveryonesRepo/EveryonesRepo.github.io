        <p>Services are programs that do not have a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
        <p>The Services category includes agents and daemons, small programs that launch as a background process to perform a specific task. Such programs are often designed to run only when needed.</p>
        <p>While there are tools available to disable services, it is generally a bad idea to do so. These services exist for a reason; disabling them may remove functionality or cause other programs to perform incorrectly. When experiencing trouble with a service, it is better to track down and solve the problem rather than just disable the service.</p>
